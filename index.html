		<p>I'm a graphic designer, in the 'print' world. I work with page layout and image programs like Indesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Acrobat, and Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint.</p>

		<p>For the last 2 years, I have struggled to find work in my field. Resigned to a stream of low-paying temp-jobs and minimal self-employment projects, I have been passed over for at least 3 full-time positions because I lack the web skills these positions require.</p>

		<p>This is why I am here in RampUp. To learn html, css, and user interface design!</p>
